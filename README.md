# vim-tasks
- - -
  
### Purpose
This plugin was built is to enable the ability to use a known configuration
standard (JSON) to implement scripts that are often run during development.
The running of these tasks should follow typical vim-like workflow and be no
more tedious than the usage of VIm.
  
### Installation
Using plug, you can install by including the following in your .vimrc file
```vim
Plug 'frankiebaffa/vim-tasks'
```
Then run the following in vim
```vim
:PlugInstall
```
